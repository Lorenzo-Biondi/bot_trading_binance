    "# Welcome to the Trading Simulator Bot! ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "This bot is designed to simulate a trading investment strategy using real-time cryptocurrency data.  \n",
    "The main purpose is to allow you to explore how different strategies would impact your investment  \n",
    "in the volatile world of crypto. Currently, the bot offers two strategies: Moving Average (MA) and  \n",
    "Relative Strength Index (RSI). But don't worry â€“ the code is built with scalability in mind, so you  \n",
    "can easily add more strategies in the future as you explore different trading techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you set your investment amount, the bot will track your balance based on the chosen strategy  \n",
    "and the market movements of Bitcoin (BTC). Youâ€™ll be able to see how your investment performs,  \n",
    "whether youâ€™re buying during bullish trends or selling during bearish moments â€“ all in the safety  \n",
    "of a simulation environment. So, get ready to test your trading knowledge and see how your strategy  \n",
    "performs in real-world market conditions!\n"
